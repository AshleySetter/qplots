# qplots
A small python plotting library

This is the qplots library produced primarily by [Ashley Setter](https://github.com/AshleySetter). It is in part accompanying and being used by my [datahandling library](https://github.com/AshleySetter/datahandling). This library has the goal of making every aspect customisable, open and transparent.

Example of joint_plot:
