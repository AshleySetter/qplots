# qplots
A small python plotting library

This is the qplots library produced primarily by [Ashley Setter](https://github.com/AshleySetter). It is in part accompanying and being used by my [datahandling library](https://github.com/AshleySetter/datahandling). This is also an attempt to solve the issues present when using seaborn's jointplot, which, while very attractive, has issues with customisability, such as not being able to plot the colorbar used. This library has the goal of making every aspect customisable, open and transparent.

Example of joint_plot:
